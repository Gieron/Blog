            <h2>My preconceptions</h2>

            <p>
                I have been using AI chatbots to get information for some time now.
            </p>

            <p>
                I understand that collaborating with an AI when writing code is a viable use case.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, I had my doubts that letting AI do all the coding could actually produce anything useful.
            </p>

            <h2>Build something</h2>

            <p>
                To challenge those doubts I used a vibe coding web site called <a href="https://lovable.dev">Lovable</a>:
            </p>

            <img src="Lovable-01.png" alt="Lovable logo with the tagline 'Create apps and websites by chatting with AI'" width="500" />

            <p>
                I created a free account and entered the following prompt:
            </p>

            <p class="prompt">
                <em>I want a web page which takes data from Vattenfall's hourly prices for electricity area 3 in Sweden and turns it into a graph for the current day.</em>
            </p>

            <p>
                The way I usually read my electricity prices is via a rather unfriendly web page where I have to scroll down quite a bit.
                My expecation was that the AI would have to find this web page and scrape its content before it could show anything.
            </p>

            <p>
                I doubted the AI would be able to do that.
            </p>

            <p>
                The AI did, in fact, not do that.
            </p>

            <p>
                Instead, it found a public API and proceeded to produce this, rather nice looking, web page:
            </p>

            <img src="Lovable-02.png" alt="Web site labeled 'Vattenfall Electricity Prices' with current price, average, min and max prices and a graph" width="600" />

            <p>
                This was seriously impressive at first sight.
            </p>

            <p>
                At second sight I realized the prices didn't match the site I used.
            </p>

            <p>
                After some prompting the AI confessed that the site wasn't showing real prices at all, it was all just dummy data.
            </p>

            <p>
                The AI took it upon itself to correct the problem and show the correct data.
            </p>

            <p>
                There was a dotted straight line in the graph that I didn't understand the meaning of.
            </p>

            <p>
                I asked the AI about it and got the explanation that it was the average price for the day.
            </p>

            <p>
                I asked for it to be replaced with a fixed line at 50 öre/kWh instead.
            </p>

            <p>
                I prompted some more changes; move the graph to the top, use a table instead of the other data and translate the whole page to Swedish.
            </p>

            <p>
                It did it all without issues.
            </p>

            <p>
                A request to remove the axis and labels from the graph took some extra prompting to get right.
            </p>

            <p>
                After a while the page looked less nice but more practical:
            </p>

            <img src="Lovable-03.png" alt="Web site labeled 'Elpriser för lördag 22 september 2025' with a graph and a table showing prices per hour" width="600" />

            <p>
                This was mostly what I wanted, but for it to be useful it needed to be hosted somewhere.
            </p>

            <p>
                That was no problem.
            </p>

            <p>
                Turns out Lovable is happy to host the site for free with the push of a button:
            </p>

            <img src="Lovable-04.png" alt="Dialog at Lovable for publishing the web site to vattenfall-prices.lovable.app" width="300" />

            <p>
                My final request was for the page to show tomorrow prices as well.
            </p>

            <p>
                In my experince, getting the prices for the next day is only possible later in the afternoon.
            </p>

            <p>
                But the page was able to show them right away.
            </p>

            <p>
                This was great. I asked the AI how it had managed that feat.
            </p>

            <p>
                Turns out it hadn't. It was using dummy data again and showing it whenever it couldn't get the real data.
            </p>

            <p>
                I suggested that an error would be more useful in that case.
            </p>

            <p>
                With that little issue fixed there was just a few more weird problems.
            </p>

            <p>
                The page showed a now indicator next to the current time even when showing the next days prices, which doesn't make sense.
            </p>

            <p>
                Also, the page didn't update the date in the header when showing the next days prices.
            </p>

            <p>
                I asked for both of these problems to be fixed.
            </p>

            <p>
                The AI fixed it but also changed the formatting of the date:
            </p>

            <img src="Lovable-05.png" alt="Header of the web site showing 'Elpriser för 2025-09-22'" width="400" />

            <p>
                I asked it to revert the format.
            </p>

            <p>
                The AI told me I could revert to a previous version myself. Which I could, though that would also revert the fixes I asked for.
            </p>

            <p>
                Some more prompting took care of that final issue.
            </p>

            <p>
                I publish the updated site and called it done.
            </p>

            <h2>My revelations</h2>

            <p>
                Vibe coding can absolutely produce something useful.
            </p>

            <p>
                It's probably most useful for non-developers. For developers it's perhaps best suited for quick prototyping.
            </p>

            <p>
                The better you know the tools (in this case Lovable) and prompting, the better your results will be.
            </p>

            <p>
                Extensive testing is recommended.
            </p>
